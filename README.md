## 🫁 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

> This Pneumonia Detection System is a medically oriented project
> designed to assist in the classification of chest X-ray images
> into Normal and Pneumonia categories with high reliability.
> The system is developed using **transfer learning** based on the
> **Pretrained model** **DenseNet-121**,which is  trained over
> the **millions  of feature image and thousands of classes** , this 
> enables  effective feature extraction and
> strong generalization on clinical imaging data.

> This project is intended strictly for **educational and research purposes**.  
> It is **not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis**.  
> All clinical decisions must be made by qualified healthcare professionals.
