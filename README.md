## 🫁 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning
    **Pneumonia Detection System** is a clinically inspired deep learning project designed to            classify chest X-ray images into **Normal** and **Pneumonia** categories with high                  reliability. The system is built using **transfer learning with DenseNet-121**, enabling            robust feature extraction and strong generalization on medical imaging data.

     The model has been carefully fine-tuned using optimized training strategies, including class        balancing and regularization techniques, to improve sensitivity on pneumonia-positive cases         while minimizing overfitting. Performance is evaluated across **training, validation, and           independent test datasets**, ensuring that the results reflect real-world applicability rather      than memorization.

    To enhance usability, the trained model is deployed through an **interactive Streamlit web          interface**, allowing users to upload chest X-ray images and receive predictions with               confidence scores in a **clean, medical-style output format**. This project demonstrates how        deep learning can serve as an effective **decision-support tool** in preliminary respiratory        disease screening.
